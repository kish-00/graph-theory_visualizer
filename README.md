# Graph Theory-Visualizer

An open-source tool to visualize operations that can be done in a graph, such as Breadth First Search, Depth First Search, Kruskal algorithm and Dijkstras algorithm.\
The goal was to have a continuous display of the various operations, so that if the graph changes while the operation is in progress, the display changes too.
